# Virtual Change Ringing

This app is a virtual bell tower! Ringers enter a name for themselves and a secret word to enter, then can assign themselves bells. Assigned bells can be rung by clicking on the bell, or hitting the indicated keys on a keyboard. The keyboard commands can be edited.

A second secret word grants "captain" powers, which at the moment are only:

- assign bells to others


## Make your own virtual tower!

Glitch makes it easy to copy an entire app. You can have your own virtual tower operational in two or three steps:

- Click `Remix to edit` to create your copy
- Add words in the `.env` file for the SECRET and CAPTAIN - these will be your secret words for entering the tower
- Create a glitch account if you want your tower to last more than five days

Once you've created a tower, you can get any updates I've made by clicking `Tools` -> `Import and Export` -> `Import from Github` and then entering "orchestrali/wary-stargazer" in the dialog that pops up. Note that if you've made any changes besides the secret words, this will overwrite them.


## Features I might add

Some things I might get around to adding:

- verbal instructions ("go next time" and the like)
- winking at another ringer (maybe just course and after bells?)
- collect striking data and see if I can do things to help with lag
